            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">While it‚Äôs a great idea to visit the Rock Islands on a boat tour, the scenic flight gives you an amazing and unique perspective that is really hard to beat.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">I joined one of these flights recently on a little prop plane with Pacific Mission Aviation, and the whole thing was such a great experience.</p>

            <h2 id="1" class="my-4"><i class="bi bi-dot" style="font-size: 40px;vertical-align: middle;"></i>Where Are The Rock Islands Located?</h2>
            <p class="h5">The Rock Islands are located about 10 kilometers (6 miles) southwest of mainland Koror, Palau, so they‚Äôre easy to reach by plane.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">With a prop plane, you can get to the very best islands in about 10 minutes, although the scenery starts as soon as you lift off from Koror!</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h2 id="2" class="my-4"><i class="bi bi-dot" style="font-size: 40px;vertical-align: middle;"></i>The Company: Pacific Mission Aviation</h2>
            <p class="h5">Scenic flights in Palau have been pioneered by a company called Pacific Mission Aviation (PMA). They were the first company to offer scenic flights over Palau.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">There‚Äôs another company now called Fish ‚Äòn Fins that also offers scenic flights, but my experience is only with PMA so that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll be sharing here.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">PMA is primarily a Christian missionary organization, and by doing a scenic flight with them you‚Äôre helping to subsidize the humanitarian and medical work they do in the islands, while also helping them offset the costs of the inter-island flights they run for Palauan locals.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h2 id="3" class="my-4"><i class="bi bi-dot" style="font-size: 40px;vertical-align: middle;"></i>Palau Scenic Flight: What To Expect</h2>
            <p class="h5">My scenic flight in Palau started with a 10:20 AM pickup from my hotel in the town of Koror.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">I was traveling solo, but I had contacted PMA in advance and they were able to join me with a group of 3 other passengers doing the Rock Islands flight that day.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">I hopped in the PMA van with the other passengers (all international tourists), and together we made the quick 20 minute drive over to PMA‚Äôs hangar at the Palau International Airport.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h2 id="4" class="my-4"><i class="bi bi-dot" style="font-size: 40px;vertical-align: middle;"></i>When Is The Best Time To Fly?</h2>
            <p class="h5">The Palau scenic flights normally go in the morning, when there‚Äôs the best chance for clear weather. The sky was totally clear when we started our tour, and we were already back at the hangar before some clouds began to build.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">The time of year that you fly doesn‚Äôt matter too much, since Palau has plenty of rain all year long. The driest months in Koror and the Rock Islands are January to April, but even those months have plenty of rain.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">I wouldn‚Äôt worry about it too much either way, because the rain tends to come in the evening or at night. You can never guarantee you‚Äôll have perfect weather no matter when you go.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h2 id="5" class="my-4"><i class="bi bi-dot" style="font-size: 40px;vertical-align: middle;"></i>What Does The Flight Cost?</h2>
            <p class="h5">As a solo traveler on this trip, I paid $180 USD plus a 3.5% charge for paying by credit card. They accept US credit cards, but not American Express.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">Their flights have a 3 passenger minimum, so that can also affect the cost. If they don‚Äôt have at least 3 passengers for your flight, then you may have to pay extra or reschedule it to another date or time.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">You can check the current prices and other terms on their website. They provide free hotel pickup and drop-off in Palau, and there‚Äôs no charge to take the doors off the plane for photography.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h2 id="6" class="my-4"><i class="bi bi-dot" style="font-size: 40px;vertical-align: middle;"></i>Is It Safe?</h2>
            <p class="h5">Pacific Mission Aviation has been doing flights in Palau since 2012. In addition to the scenic flights, they also do inter-island flights in Palau to places like Angaur and Peleliu, so they have a fair amount of experience.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">A plane is only as safe as the person flying it, but the Cessna 206 is generally known to be a safe and reliable aircraft. I wouldn‚Äôt want to fly one every day for my occupation, but I think a short scenic flight like this is very safe.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h2 id="7" class="my-4"><i class="bi bi-dot" style="font-size: 40px;vertical-align: middle;"></i>Is It Worth It?</h2>
            <p class="h5">Yes, I think the Palau scenic flight is totally worth it! This is one of the best landscapes in the world, and there‚Äôs no better way to see it than from above.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">It‚Äôs an amazing experience, and the price is very reasonable for what you get. For comparison, I paid almost twice as much for my Great Blue Hole flight in Belize, and also for the Franz Josef glacier helicopter tour that my wife and I did in New Zealand.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">On the Palau flight, I was able to take lots of great pictures of the Rock Islands, and overall it was much better and cheaper than similar tours I‚Äôve done around the world.</p>

            <h2 id="8" class="my-4"><i class="bi bi-dot" style="font-size: 40px;vertical-align: middle;"></i>Fun Facts About The Rock Islands Of Palau</h2>
            <p class="h5"><b>Why are they called the Rock Islands?</b><br>
                The Rock Islands may not look like rocks, but they actually are in fact limestone rock formations covered with tropical vegetation.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5"><b>How many islands are there?</b><br>
                According to UNESCO, there are approximately 445 uninhabited islands in the Rock Islands Southern Lagoon, and they cover a total area of 100,200 hectares (about 250,000 acres).</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5"><b>What is the UNESCO status?</b><br>
                The Rock Islands Southern Lagoon has been recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2012, because of its exceptional beauty, natural biodiversity, and cultural value.</p>

            <p class="h5"><b>Which airport is used for the flights?</b><br>
                The PMA scenic flight departs from the Roman Tmetuchl International Airport, also known as the Palau International Airport in Koror. However, for the tour, you‚Äôll go to PMA‚Äôs office and hangar, which is on the north apron side of the Palau airport </p>

            <p class="h5"><b>Can you take pictures?</b><br>
                Yes, you can take pictures to your heart‚Äôs content! I took more than 200 photos with my camera during the flight, plus some videos with my phone. They were even cool enough to let me mount my GoPro on the plane wing for another perspective.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5"><b>Which seat is best?</b><br>
                The two right seats are best since they normally open the door on the right side of the plane. In my case, I was put in a corner seat on the left side of the plane, but I was still able to take pictures by craning over to the right side. The plane is small enough you‚Äôll have nice views in any seat.</p>
