            <p class="h5">We booked our Antelope Canyon tours with GetYourGuide and had a great experience.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">The price includes your entry tickets and a Navajo local guide. Everything was communicated clearly by email, and they have a refund policy if you need to cancel in advance.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">We‚Äôve used GetYourGuide for lots of tours and activities around the world, and they‚Äôre great. Highly recommended!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h2 id="2" class="my-4"><i class="bi bi-dot" style="font-size: 40px;vertical-align: middle;"></i>Antelope Canyon Comparison: Upper vs Lower vs X</h2>
            <p class="h5">So which Antelope Canyon is best ‚Äî Upper, Lower, or X? That‚Äôs a good question.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">For us, I would have to say the winner for best value (and overall experience) was Antelope Canyon X. While it may lack a few of the features that are great for photography in the Upper and Lower canyons, it‚Äôs a longer tour, meaning you have more time to take pictures and get creative.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">On top of that, Canyon X is also much less crowded with tourists compared to the others, and you don‚Äôt have to worry about being badgered and rushed through the slot, like at Upper Canyon.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h2 id="3" class="my-4"><i class="bi bi-dot" style="font-size: 40px;vertical-align: middle;"></i>Scenery/Photography</h2>
            <p class="h5">Obviously, one of the main things you may be wondering about is scenery and photography. Which Antelope Canyon is the most beautiful? Which one has the nicest colors? Which one is best for photography? Of course, that‚Äôs subjective and a bit hard to answer, because they‚Äôre all exceptionally nice.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">Upper Antelope Canyon is mainly known for its dramatic light beams, which can be seen in the summer months when the sun is high in the sky. During this time, beams of light shine through the narrow roof of the canyon, illuminating the dust in the air. It‚Äôs a spectacular effect that‚Äôs great for pictures, although I think it‚Äôs a little overrated since it can only be seen in the summer during the middle of the day.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">Lower Antelope Canyon has a shallower ‚ÄòV‚Äô shaped chamber, which means it lets in more light than the Upper Canyon. Because of this, it‚Äôs best seen at times when there‚Äôs less ambient light, such as in the morning hours. The Lower Canyon has wonderful colors, and it‚Äôs full of twisting passageways and interesting rock features that are great for photos.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h2 id="4" class="my-4"><i class="bi bi-dot" style="font-size: 40px;vertical-align: middle;"></i>Crowds</h2>
            <p class="h5">So which Antelope Canyon is less crowded? Which one is the least touristy?</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">Unfortunately, Upper and Lower Antelope Canyon are the losers here. They‚Äôve become victims of their own popularity, and the tourist crowds nowadays are so bad you‚Äôll often find it hard to move around or take photos. Forget about ever retracing your steps for a picture; everyone is shuffled through quickly in a line and this is strictly enforced.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">In our experience, the crowds were the worst at the Lower Antelope Canyon, because it‚Äôs a bigger chamber and they‚Äôre able to run more tours through it every day. More tours also means more people. You‚Äôll be in the middle of a crowd at all times, with people sticking their phones in your face trying to take selfies.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h2 id="5" class="my-4"><i class="bi bi-dot" style="font-size: 40px;vertical-align: middle;"></i>Duration</h2>
            <p class="h5">In my experience, only about 30 minutes were actually spent inside the Upper Canyon, and it felt even shorter than that because you can never pause or stand still for more than a few seconds. The tour was extremely rushed, and we passed through one of the main chambers so quickly I didn‚Äôt even get to take a photo.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">In contrast, the tours at the other canyons are longer and more relaxed. This is especially true at Antelope Canyon X, where we spent more than 1 hour inside the slot canyon sections. We were able to walk slowly and take lots of pictures while also chatting with the Navajo guide about some of the history of the canyon. It was a much better experience and we felt like we got more value for our money.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">The results speak for themselves. I took hundreds of photos in Lower Antelope and Canyon X, while I only managed to take a handful of photos in Upper Antelope Canyon because I was so rushed and limited on time there.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h2 id="6" class="my-4"><i class="bi bi-dot" style="font-size: 40px;vertical-align: middle;"></i>Fun</h2>
            <p class="h5">So which of the canyons is the most fun to explore? I know, this is totally subjective, but it‚Äôs still important because the reason most of us are visiting Antelope Canyon is to have fun!</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">I have to say, my wife and I had the most fun at Lower Antelope Canyon. Our Navajo guide pointed out a bunch of different rock formations with unique shapes, including a dragon, an eagle, and a tribal chief.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">The narrow twisting corners were also fun for peekaboo type photos, and although not everyone might agree, we even had fun climbing the stairs and ladders!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h2 id="7" class="my-4"><i class="bi bi-dot" style="font-size: 40px;vertical-align: middle;"></i>Accessibility</h2>
            <p class="h5">So which Antelope Canyon is best in terms of access and safety? Which one is the least strenuous hike? Depending on the tour provider, young kids, pregnant women, and older folks are allowed in any of the canyons, although it may not always be the best idea.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">Upper Antelope is probably the winner here. The entrance to the slot canyon is at ground level, so you don‚Äôt have to climb any steep stairs or ladders to reach it, and after exiting you just walk across a short slope to get back to the car. It‚Äôs very tame. There‚Äôs a bumpy 15 minute drive in the back of a pickup truck to get to the canyon entrance, but the truckbed is covered and has benches to sit on, and the drivers don‚Äôt go fast. If you can handle that, then you‚Äôre good to go.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">There‚Äôs no bumpy drive like this for Lower Antelope, but getting in and out of the slot is a bit harder since it requires climbing down a steep metal staircase. You still don‚Äôt need to be very fit to do it, and pregnant women can do it fine as long as they‚Äôre slow and careful. My wife did it in her second trimester and had no issues.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">

            <p class="h5">So which Antelope Canyon is best in terms of availability? In other words, how easy is it to get a tour on short notice and choose the time and date that you want?</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">Upper Antelope is the hardest canyon to get a tour, and you may have to book months in advance to get the date and time you want. There are a couple of reasons for this. Since the Upper Canyon is smaller than the Lower Canyon or X Canyon, it fills up easier and they aren‚Äôt able to run as many tours per day. It‚Äôs also very famous for the sunbeams, which have made it even more sought after by photographers.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">Lower Antelope is also highly popular, but it‚Äôs a bigger canyon and they can accommodate more tours every day. We booked only one day in advance, and had no problem getting a time that worked for us, although we may have gotten lucky (your experience may vary).</p>

            <p class="h5">Obviously the tour prices will vary a bit depending on where and when you book them, but in general the most expensive tour is the Upper Antelope Canyon, followed by Lower Antelope and Canyon X, in that order.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">Prices for the Upper Antelope Canyon tour can be as high as $150 USD per person during the summer season. In contrast, prices for the Antelope Canyon X tour can be as low as $60 USD, which is well worth it! I consider that a great bargain for what you get to see and do there.</p>
