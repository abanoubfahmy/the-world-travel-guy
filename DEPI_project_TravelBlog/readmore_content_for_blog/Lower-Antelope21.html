            <p class="h5">We recently went to Arizona and tried all of the Antelope Canyon tours, including the two main sections: Upper Canyon and Lower Canyon. This is our complete review from the Lower Antelope Canyon.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">If you haven‚Äôt heard of Antelope Canyon, it‚Äôs a narrow passage in the desert with smooth, curving walls of orange and purple sandstone. This chamber was carved by wind and water over the course of many years, leaving the beautiful slot canyon you can see today.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">One important thing to note is that Antelope Canyon is located on the Navajo reservation, so unfortunately the only way to visit it is with a tour and a local Navajo guide. However, since this place has become such a popular bucket list item nowadays, the tour system is basically needed anyway for crowd control.</p>

            <p class="h5">We booked our Lower Antelope Canyon tour with GetYourGuide and had a great experience. The price includes your entry tickets, Navajo permit fee, and a local Navajo guide. Everything was communicated clearly by email, and they have a refund policy if you need to cancel in advance.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">They also have tours for Upper Antelope Canyon, Antelope X, and some of the more specialized canyons in the same area that get less visitor traffic than the main canyons.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">We‚Äôve used GetYourGuide for lots of tours and activities around the world, and they‚Äôre great. Highly recommended!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h2 id="2" class="my-4"><i class="bi bi-dot" style="font-size: 40px;vertical-align: middle;"></i>Lower Antelope Canyon Review: What To Expect On The Tour</h2>
            <p class="h5">The Lower Antelope Canyon tour takes you through a slot canyon that is below ground.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">This involves a short, sandy walk to get to the slot, and then you climb down some metal stairs, go through the slot in single file at a relaxed pace, and then climb up some stairs to go back to the starting point.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">When we started the tour, they first had us sit and watch a short Navajo tribal dance with music that was included for free as part of our experience. This was an added bonus and tips are optional. They didn‚Äôt ask us to pay anything.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h2 id="3" class="my-4"><i class="bi bi-dot" style="font-size: 40px;vertical-align: middle;"></i>Best Time To Visit Lower Antelope Canyon</h2>
            <p class="h5">The best time to visit Lower Antelope Canyon really depends on what you‚Äôre looking for. If you want to avoid the crowds and heat, the best time to go is from November to March. However, the most spectacular lighting is arguably in the summer months.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">Compared to the Upper Canyon, this one has a wider ceiling and it gets a lot more ambient light from the sun, which means it can actually get very bright inside ‚Äî possibly too bright for ideal photos.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">This means the best time of day to visit Lower Canyon is actually in the morning or late afternoon, when there‚Äôs not too much light and contrast inside the canyon.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h2 id="4" class="my-4"><i class="bi bi-dot" style="font-size: 40px;vertical-align: middle;"></i>Is The Tour Worth It?</h2>
            <p class="h5">Yes, the Lower Canyon is definitely worth it for the sights and scenery, even though the crowds dampen the experience a bit. This is undoubtedly one of the most unique and beautiful slot canyons in the United States.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">The price for the tour is not exactly cheap, but it‚Äôs still quite a bit more affordable than the Upper Antelope Canyon, which can be as high as $150 USD per person during the summer season. Lower Canyon is also a better value overall since the tour isn‚Äôt as rushed.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h2 id="5" class="my-4"><i class="bi bi-dot" style="font-size: 40px;vertical-align: middle;"></i>Lower vs Upper Antelope Canyon: Which Is Best?</h2>
            <p class="h5">We tried all of the Antelope Canyon tours over the course of a week, and I have to admit we liked the Upper Canyon the least, although it was still amazing to see.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">Upper Antelope Canyon is mainly known for its dramatic light beams, which can be seen in the summer months when the sun is high in the sky. If you aren‚Äôt interested in the sunbeams, then the Lower Canyon is better in most ways.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">Compared to Upper Antelope, the Lower Canyon tour is longer, more relaxed, and more fun, in my opinion. It‚Äôs also cheaper and easier to get a spot in the Lower Canyon since they run more tours every day. I‚Äôd say the scenery is also pretty comparable between the two.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h2 id="6" class="my-4"><i class="bi bi-dot" style="font-size: 40px;vertical-align: middle;"></i>What To Do On The Tour (And What NOT To Do)</h2>
            <p class="h5"><b>What To Bring:</b> A driver‚Äôs license or other ID, such as a passport, for check in. It‚Äôs highly recommended to wear a hat and sunscreen too. During the tour, you can bring a water bottle, and a camera or phone for taking pictures.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5"><b>What NOT To Bring:</b> You can‚Äôt bring pets, bags, backpacks, strollers, drones, canes, umbrellas, hiking sticks, selfie sticks, or tripods. They don‚Äôt allow bags of any kind in the canyon. Not even a small camera bag or fanny pack. You‚Äôll have to leave these in your car at the parking lot. These are the same rules they have for all of the Navajo Nation slot canyons.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5"><b>What NOT To Do:</b> They don‚Äôt allow smoking, climbing, writing, flash photography, or video recording on the Lower Antelope Canyon tours. Non-flash photos are fine, and you can take as many as you want, although they don‚Äôt allow you to take pictures on the stairways.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h2 id="7" class="my-4"><i class="bi bi-dot" style="font-size: 40px;vertical-align: middle;"></i>Other Tips For The Lower Antelope Canyon Tour</h2>
            <p class="h5"><b>Bathrooms:</b> There are toilets at the office before you start the tour, but no bathrooms during the tour, so you‚Äôll want to take care of business before you start.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5"><b>When To Book:</b> In general, getting a spot in Lower Antelope isn‚Äôt quite as hard as the Upper Canyon, but it‚Äôs still a good idea to make a reservation at least 2 to 4 weeks in advance, especially during the spring and summer months.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5"><b>Time Zones:</b> There are multiple time zones used in this part of Arizona, which can get confusing, and it sometimes causes people to show up at the wrong time for their tour of Antelope Canyon. This is because the Navajo Nation observes Daylight Saving Time, but the rest of Arizona does not. Your phone may also switch time zones automatically while driving around in the state. However, the important thing to remember is that the Antelope Canyon tour companies all operate in the same time zone as Page, Arizona. You‚Äôll want to set your clocks to Page, AZ local time, and make sure that‚Äôs when you show up.</p>

                This is a slot canyon on Navajo tribal land near Page, Arizona. Together with the Upper Canyon (which is visited by a separate tour), it‚Äôs one of the most famous parts of the Antelope canyon complex.

            <p class="h5"><b>Why the name? Why is it called Lower Antelope Canyon?</b><br>
                The Upper Canyon is above ground, while the Lower Canyon is below ground. Even though the name ‚ÄòLower‚Äô might give the impression that it‚Äôs inferior or less spectacular in some way, rest assured it is not. We actually liked the Lower Canyon more than Upper!</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5"><b>How far is this from the Upper Antelope Canyon?</b><br>
                Lower and Upper Canyon are very close to each other. In fact, the offices are right across the highway from each other, although to reach the Upper Canyon you have to go off-road in a company truck for about 3 miles (5 km).</p>
