            <h2 id="1" class="my-4"><i class="bi bi-dot" style="font-size: 40px;vertical-align: middle;"></i>How To Get To Luwuk & Banggai</h2>
            <p class="h5">Paisu Pok Lake is located on Peleng island, which is part of the Banggai Islands Regency in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">To get there, the first step is getting to Luwuk. There are daily, non-stop flights to the Luwuk airport (LUW) from Makassar in South Sulawesi. If you‚Äôre coming from Bali, Jakarta, or somewhere else in Indonesia, then you‚Äôll have to transit in Makassar on the way to Luwuk. You can shop for flights on Skyscanner.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">Once you arrive in Luwuk, there are taxi drivers waiting to take you to town and the drive is only about 20 minutes. We paid 50k Rupiah for the airport transfer.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h2 id="2" class="my-4"><i class="bi bi-dot" style="font-size: 40px;vertical-align: middle;"></i>How To Get To Paisu Pok Lake</h2>
            <p class="h5">The ferry from Luwuk will bring you to Leme-Leme port on Peleng, which is still 23 kilometers from the Paisu Pok Lake.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">You can then rent a scooter from Novpitri Homestay near the harbor, or hire a private driver with a car. Google Maps says it‚Äôs a 40 minute drive, but it actually takes closer to 1 hour by scooter because some parts of the road are broken and you have to slow down to pass them safely.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">There‚Äôs very little traffic on the road and it‚Äôs easy to find the lake. You can‚Äôt get lost, especially if you download an offline map beforehand. Here‚Äôs the location to use for navigation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h2 id="3" class="my-4"><i class="bi bi-dot" style="font-size: 40px;vertical-align: middle;"></i>Paisu Pok Lake: What To Expect</h2>
            <p class="h5">Paisu Pok Lake is just as nice as it looks in pictures. We first saw it in the morning, and we thought that was stunning, but the color and clarity gets even better when the sun shines on it.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">You can rent a small boat, canoe, or standup paddleboard for exploring the lake, or you can swim and snorkel in it. The water is cold in the morning, but by midday it felt perfect and it was a great escape from the heat and humidity of Sulawesi.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">The inside of the lake is almost as beautiful as the outside, with fallen logs and rocks that give it personality, and the color of the water seems to change with the lighting.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h2 id="4" class="my-4"><i class="bi bi-dot" style="font-size: 40px;vertical-align: middle;"></i>Conservation At Paisu Pok Lake</h2>
            <p class="h5">This is a small lake and it‚Äôs very beautiful, so there‚Äôs a danger of it becoming overdeveloped. I hope the locals and visitors will be serious about conservation.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">who is Indonesian, made sure to thank the locals for protecting the lake, and politely asked/encouraged them to keep the natural scenery and not cut down too many more trees around the edge of the lake in the future. I‚Äôm afraid of that happening as it becomes more popular.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">The jungle is half the beauty, and it would be really sad if they turn it into a tacky concrete theme park with swings, fake bird nests, and other silly photo ops everywhere, kind of like what‚Äôs happening now at Alas Harum and some other popular places in Bali.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">

            <p class="h5"><b>Facilities:</b> There‚Äôs a small shop at the lake where you can buy food and drinks, and also a toilet and changing room.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5"><b>Where To Stay:</b> There are a bunch of very basic homestays in the Luk Panenteng village by the lake. If you stay there, you can walk to the lake and swim every day. We stayed at Novpitri Homestay, which is a bit farther away at Leme Leme. Another option is to stay in Salakan, which is a much more developed and comfortable town, but it‚Äôs a 3 hour drive from the lake.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5"><b>Language Barrier:</b> This area is still very new to international tourism, so you‚Äôll have to be patient with the locals and maybe download a translator app for communication. They can barely speak English, but they‚Äôre friendly and helpful, and they can even assist you with taking photos or videos at the lake.</p>

            <h2 id="7" class="my-4"><i class="bi bi-dot" style="font-size: 40px;vertical-align: middle;"></i>Best Time To Visit Paisu Pok Lake</h2>
            <p class="h5">Any month is okay for visiting Paisupok Lake. The only time it would be hard to photograph is if it‚Äôs raining, so I would prefer going in the dry season, which is normally April to November in Indonesia. However, Banggai seems to follow its own weather pattern and it‚Äôs not very predictable. We visited Paisu Pok in early December and it was sunny all day.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">The best time of week to visit the lake is definitely on a weekday, and you should try to avoid any Indonesian holidays as well. Weekends at the lake are already getting very busy because of Indonesian domestic tourists, and they‚Äôve actually started doing a 1 hour time limit for staying on the boardwalk near the lake because it gets so crowded on weekends.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">Surprisingly, the best time of day to visit the lake is probably in the afternoon. We got there in the early morning at around 7 AM thinking that would be best, but it wasn‚Äôt, in my opinion. There was a group of Indonesian tourists who came even earlier with the same idea. The lake was also too dark and backlit for photos, and it didn‚Äôt seem warm enough yet for swimming.</p>

            <h2 id="8" class="my-4"><i class="bi bi-dot" style="font-size: 40px;vertical-align: middle;"></i>Is Paisu Pok Lake Worth It?</h2>
            <p class="h5">Yes, the lake is worth it. It‚Äôs amazing and I think it lives up to the hype on social media, although that could change someday if it becomes overdeveloped.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">Would I travel all the way to Luwuk just to see Paisu Pok Lake? Maybe not, but there‚Äôs lots of other stuff to see and do in Banggai, so if you‚Äôre already traveling in Sulawesi it‚Äôs definitely worth setting aside at least a few days for it.</p>
