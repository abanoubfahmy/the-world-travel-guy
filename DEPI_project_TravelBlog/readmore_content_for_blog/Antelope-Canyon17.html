            <p class="h5">We recently traveled through Arizona and tried all of the Antelope Canyon tours over the course of a week, and I would have to say our favorite was the Antelope Canyon X! Here‚Äôs our complete review from the visit.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">If you haven‚Äôt heard of Antelope Canyon, it‚Äôs arguably the most famous and beautiful slot canyon in the United States, with its colorful walls, narrow passageways, and dramatic light beams peeking through the ceiling.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">However, Antelope Canyon X tours explore a new section of the canyon that‚Äôs only been open to the public for just a few years, so it‚Äôs much less crowded and touristy compared to the main canyon, which has already become extremely popular.</p>

            <h2 id="1" class="my-4"><i class="bi bi-dot" style="font-size: 40px;vertical-align: middle;"></i>Best Antelope Canyon X Tours</h2>
            <p class="h5">We booked our Antelope Canyon X tour with GetYourGuide and had a great experience. The price includes your entry tickets and a Navajo local guide. Everything was communicated clearly by email, and they have a refund policy if you need to cancel in advance.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">If you‚Äôre coming from Las Vegas, they also have a full day trip to Antelope Canyon X and Horseshoe Bend that includes pickup and drop-off from Las Vegas. This is more pricey, and it‚Äôs a long day trip, but it could be a good option if you‚Äôre in Vegas without your own transportation and still want to see Antelope Canyon.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">We‚Äôve used GetYourGuide for lots of tours and activities around the world, and they‚Äôre great. Highly recommended!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h2 id="2" class="my-4"><i class="bi bi-dot" style="font-size: 40px;vertical-align: middle;"></i>Antelope Canyon X Review: What To Expect On The Tour</h2>
            <p class="h5">The Antelope Canyon X tour visits two different nice slot canyon sections that are separated by a short, sandy wash.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">After a quick check in process at the company‚Äôs parking lot, we hopped in an air-conditioned van and drove through the desert for 10 or 15 minutes to the start of the canyon. The road was a little bumpy, but nothing too terrible.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">To reach the mouth of the slot canyon, you follow your guide and walk down a flight of wooden stairs for another 5 or 10 minutes. You‚Äôll be in the sun for awhile at first, although there are places to stop and rest in the shade.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h2 id="3" class="my-4"><i class="bi bi-dot" style="font-size: 40px;vertical-align: middle;"></i>Best Time To Visit Antelope Canyon X</h2>
            <p class="h5">The best time to visit Antelope Canyon X is generally from the end of March to the beginning of October. The reason for this is because the lighting is better outside of the winter months.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">However, unlike the Upper and Lower canyons, any time of day is good for visiting Antelope X. We went on an afternoon in May at 2:00 PM, and the lighting was great, although you could probably avoid some of the heat by going a bit earlier in the day.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">The slots have some areas that are deep, and others that are shallow, so it can be beautiful and photogenic in a variety of lighting conditions.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h2 id="4" class="my-4"><i class="bi bi-dot" style="font-size: 40px;vertical-align: middle;"></i>Is The Tour Worth It?</h2>
            <p class="h5">Yes, the Canyon X is totally worth it! Prices for the tour can be as low as $60 USD per person, which is a real bargain in my opinion.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">In contrast, prices for the Upper Antelope Canyon can be as high as $150 USD per person during the summer season, and it‚Äôs a much more rushed and crowded tour.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h2 id="5" class="my-4"><i class="bi bi-dot" style="font-size: 40px;vertical-align: middle;"></i>Antelope Canyon X vs Upper/Lower: Which Is Best?</h2>
            <p class="h5">So which Antelope Canyon is best ‚Äî Upper, Lower, or X? That‚Äôs a good question.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">We tried all of the Antelope Canyon tours over the course of a week, and I would have to say the winner for best value (and overall experience) was Antelope Canyon X.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5">While Canyon X may lack a few of the features that are great for photography in the Upper and Lower canyons, it‚Äôs a longer tour, meaning you have more time to look around, take pictures, and get creative.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h2 id="6" class="my-4"><i class="bi bi-dot" style="font-size: 40px;vertical-align: middle;"></i>What To Do On The Tour (And What NOT To Do)</h2>
            <p class="h5"><b>What To Bring:</b> A driver‚Äôs license or other ID, such as a passport, for check in. It‚Äôs highly recommended to wear a hat and sunscreen too. During the tour, you can bring a water bottle, and a camera or phone for taking pictures, and older folks can also bring a walking stick if needed.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5"><b>What NOT To Bring:</b> You can‚Äôt bring pets, bags, backpacks, strollers, metal frame baby carriers, drones, selfie sticks, or tripods. They don‚Äôt allow bags of any kind in the canyon. Not even a small camera bag or fanny pack. You‚Äôll have to leave these in your car at the parking lot. These are the same rules they have for all of the Navajo Nation slot canyons.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5"><b>What NOT To Do:</b> They don‚Äôt allow smoking, climbing, writing, flash photography, or video recording on the Antelope Canyon X tours. Non-flash photos are fine, and you can take as many as you want.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h2 id="7" class="my-4"><i class="bi bi-dot" style="font-size: 40px;vertical-align: middle;"></i>Other Tips For The Antelope Canyon X Tour</h2>
            <p class="h5"><b>Bathrooms:</b> There are portable toilets near the waiting area before you begin your tour, but no bathrooms during the tour, so you‚Äôll want to take care of business before you start.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5"><b>When To Book:</b> In general, Antelope X is the easiest canyon to visit. You can usually book a tour at the last minute and still get a spot. Of course, that may change someday as it gets more popular.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5"><b>Time Zones:</b> There are multiple time zones used in this part of Arizona, which can get confusing, and it sometimes causes people to show up at the wrong time for their tour of Antelope Canyon. This is because the Navajo Nation observes Daylight Saving Time, but the rest of Arizona does not. Your phone may also switch time zones automatically while driving around in the state. However, the important thing to remember is that the Antelope Canyon tour companies all operate in the same time zone as Page, Arizona. You‚Äôll want to set your clocks to Page, AZ local time, and make sure that‚Äôs when you show up.</p>

            <p class="h5"><b>What is Antelope Canyon X?</b><br>
                Antelope Canyon X is a slot canyon on Navajo tribal land near Page, Arizona. It‚Äôs one of the less famous (but still beautiful) parts of the Antelope slot canyon complex.</p>

            <p class="h5"><b>Why the name? Where is the X?</b><br>
                Antelope Canyon X gets its name from an X-shaped hole in the ceiling near the start of the slot canyon. Your Navajo guide will probably point out this feature to you during your tour, otherwise you can ask and they‚Äôll show it to you.</p>
            <div class="w-100"></div>
            <p class="h5"><b>How far is this from the main Antelope Canyon?</b><br>
                All of the Antelope Canyon slots are located fairly close to each other. The Canyon X is located 5 miles (8 km) from Upper Antelope Canyon, while it‚Äôs about 9 miles (14 km) from Lower Antelope Canyon. They‚Äôre all near the town of Page, Arizona, but you have to book a separate tour for each one because they have different management.</p>
